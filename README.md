# Mysterious-Organism

Codecademy project - Create factory function that generates DNA samples and organises potential good samples into an array.

Self written functions, so may not be the cleanest or best ways to achieve results.

Tasks:
- Create factory function to generate Sample objects
- Objects to contain object methods that:
  - mutate() Change a random item in the object array, with another random item that musn't be the same as original
  - compareDNA() Compare two arrays and return a percentage value for how similar the arrays are
  - willLikelySurvive() Checks an array for percentage occurance of certain items and returns true or false if satisfied
- Added pAequorSurviveGenerator() which can be used with a number perameter, to generate a required number of objects
